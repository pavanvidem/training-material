## MetaBAT 2

In this tutorial version we will learn how to use **MetaBAT 2** {%cite Kang2019%} tool through Galaxy. **MetaBAT** stands for "Metagenome Binning based on Abundance and Tetranucleotide frequency". It is:

> Grouping large fragments assembled from shotgun metagenomic sequences to deconvolute complex microbial communities, or metagenome binning, enables the study of individual organisms and their interactions. Here we developed automated metagenome binning software, called MetaBAT, which integrates empirical probabilistic distances of genome abundance and tetranucleotide frequency. On synthetic datasets MetaBAT on average achieves 98percent precision and 90% recall at the strain level with 281 near complete unique genomes. Applying MetaBAT to a human gut microbiome data set we recovered 176 genome bins with 92% precision and 80% recall. Further analyses suggest MetaBAT is able to recover genome fragments missed in reference genomes up to 19%, while 53 genome bins are novel. In summary, we believe MetaBAT is a powerful tool to facilitate comprehensive understanding of complex microbial communities.

MetaBAT is a popular software tool for metagenomics binning, and there are several reasons why it is often used:
- *High accuracy*: MetaBAT uses a combination of tetranucleotide frequency, coverage depth, and read linkage information to bin contigs, which has been shown to be highly accurate and efficient.
- *Easy to use*: MetaBAT has a user-friendly interface and can be run on a standard desktop computer, making it accessible to a wide range of researchers with varying levels of computational expertise.
- *Flexibility*: MetaBAT can be used with a variety of sequencing technologies, including Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore, and can be applied to both microbial and viral metagenomes.
- *Scalability*: MetaBAT can handle large-scale datasets, and its performance has been shown to improve with increasing sequencing depth.
- *Compatibility*: MetaBAT outputs MAGs in standard formats that can be easily integrated into downstream analyses and tools, such as taxonomic annotation and functional prediction.

The output files generated by MetaBAT 2 include (some of the files below are optional and not produced unless it is required by the user):

1. The final set of genome bins in FASTA format (`.fa`)
2. A summary file with information on each genome bin, including its length, completeness, contamination, and taxonomy classification (`.txt`)
3. A file with the mapping results showing how each contig was assigned to a genome bin (`.bam`)
4. A file containing the abundance estimation of each genome bin (`.txt`)
5. A file with the coverage profile of each genome bin (`.txt`)
6. A file containing the nucleotide composition of each genome bin (`.txt`)
7. A file with the predicted gene sequences of each genome bin (`.faa`)

These output files can be further analyzed and used for downstream applications such as functional annotation, comparative genomics, and phylogenetic analysis.
